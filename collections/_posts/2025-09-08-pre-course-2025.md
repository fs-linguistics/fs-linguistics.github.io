Begin your academic journey with our 5-day orientation event!

The pre-course is an opportunity for incoming General and Computational Linguistics students to get a first introduction to their degree through talks, guided workshops, and tours held by students from the Fachschaft and some of your  tutors.

**Please bring a laptop** (+ charger).

**ALL** students (both GL and CL) are strongly recommended to obtain a laptop for their studies NOW - e.g. there are mandatory programming courses scheduled for the first semester of the Bachelors.

## Schedule
Mon, Oct 13th 11:00 - 13:00

There are also two introductory meetings taking place on Monday; the first one at 14:00 is aimed at GL students (but CL students are also encouraged to come), and the second is at 16:00 and aimed at CL students. We strongly encourage you to attend these meetings. You will get an overview and a quick description of all the courses you have to take.
