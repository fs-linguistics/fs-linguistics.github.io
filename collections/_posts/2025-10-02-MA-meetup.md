Are you a GL/CL master's student who's looking to get to know other people within the degree?  
Come along to our meetup on Thursday (16/10) in Brechtbau! Drop by from 4pm onwards for some chats, cakes and tea/coffee. Everyone is welcome, no matter if you're just starting the master's or have been here longer.

If you're thinking about coming, please fill out this form so we know how many of you to expect: [https://forms.gle/72vMSbZpws4aoXYZ6](https://forms.gle/72vMSbZpws4aoXYZ6)  
You don't have to sign up to come, it would just help us out to figure out how many snacks to prepare :)
