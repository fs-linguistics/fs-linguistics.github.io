title: Buddy programme 2020/21

Since there will be few in-person, on-campus activities that are going to take this semester, we want to make it easier for you to get to know your classmates and other students at the linguistics institute.

One of our plans is to create a **buddy programme** for new and returning students alike. Ideally, we'd like to match up each interested new student with a returning student with matching interests, but we might create other constellations of small student groups if necessary.

To make this happen, we need you (current and future SfS students) to sign up!
Just fill out [the linked questionnaire](/files/events/buddy-programme-2020.pdf) and email it to `nwsinf1 AT uni-tuebingen DOT de` until **November 4th**.

Q&A:
- Do I need to be in Tübingen (now or during the semester) to join? No, 'online' students can also be matched up with one another.
- Do I need to have received all of my matriculation materials (student ID, email account) to sign up? No, you can sign up with a non-university email address as well.
- Does it matter if this will be my first/last/etc. semester at the SfS or if I am a BA or MA student? No, all SfS students are welcome and encouraged to participate :)
- Any other questions? Please send us an email!

Thank you to everyone who already signed up!
