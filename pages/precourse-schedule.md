## 📍 Where?

Meet us at the University of Tübingen in one of the lecture halls where you might have lectures later on! The event will take place in the building of our Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft in *Keplerstraße 2, lecture hall 001* (when you enter through the main door from Keplerstraße, it’s the first door on your left).
